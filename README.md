Telegram Location Tracker

In this repository we have made a software that tells us the location of the person we have called on Telegram.
This repository contains a Python script that uses the Kivy library to create a GUI with two buttons: one to open the Telegram app on an Ubuntu laptop and another to start tracking IP addresses. The script uses tshark to capture network packets and extract IP addresses from them. It then uses the ipapi service to retrieve information about the city, country, and organization associated with each IP address.
